<h1>Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

As a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company, I learn that the company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. This project will compose a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

<h2>NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1</h2>

NIST SP 800-30 is a publication that offers guidance for conducting risk assessments. It provides a framework for the identification, analysis, and mitigation of risks. Utilized by organizations, NIST SP 800-30 assists in evaluating the potential probability and impact of risks, facilitating informed decisions regarding resource allocation, implementation of controls, and prioritization of remedial actions.

This project will use NIST SP 800-30 as a guideline for performing this vulnerability assessment.
