<h1>Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

As a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company, I learn that the company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. This project will compose a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

<h2>NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1</h2>

The NIST SP 800-30 publication offers guidance on the process of conducting risk assessments, including the identification, analysis, and remediation of risks. This publication is utilized by organizations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential likelihood and severity of risks, which in turn enables them to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources, implementation of controls, and prioritization of remediation efforts. I will use the NIST SP 800-30 as a guideline for preparing the vulnerability assessment.
